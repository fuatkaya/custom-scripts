###### I would like to share with you the script code of an index that is effective in estimating yield.
Using the RE-OSAVI, high accuracy coefficient was found (r2tillering = 0.629) for wheat yield at the tillering stage, whereas low accuracy coefficients were observed during the heading and ripening stages (0.412 and 0.333, respectively). 
A correlation coefficient of 0.793 (P < 0.01) was observed between the wheat yields and RE-OSAVI values during the tillering period.

####  İndices
RE-OSAVI
General Formula: RE−OSAVI=( 1+0.16 )×[(NIR-REedge)/(NIR+REedge+0.16)] 

##code
let L = 0.16;
let index = (B08 - B04) / (B08 + B04 + L) * (1.0 + L); 
return [index] #/ grayscale
